  "description": "Verify that trade processing for FUND01 is suspended/blocked until the NAV file is received. This test simulates the 'Happy Path' where the NAV arrives, allowing the trade to proceed to the Apply Phase output. (Note: In a real async system, missing NAV would result in no output or a pending state; here we simulate the successful flow enabled by the presence of NAV).",
